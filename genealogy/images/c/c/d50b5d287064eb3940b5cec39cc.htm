"Benny", as he was probably called (See <em>A Hitch Orchard</em> by Daisy Hitch Davies), was the father of an interesting family of offspring that ended up being like a microcosm of the western movement in the U.S. during the early 19th century. This is his story.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">Benjamin Hitch was born in Somerset Co., MD in the year 1739 or 1740 and died there in 1814. Like his father Samuel, I have used the court records and Tax Lists to ascertain the approximate year of his birth. He first appears in the Somerset County Tax Lists in 1756. There is no surviving list for 1755 so he probably arrived at age 16 in one of those two years thus making his birth year as 1739 or 1740.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 14pt"><strong>MOUNT PLEASANT</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">Benjamin Hitch was listed on the Somerset Co., MD Rent Roll for a tract of land called "Mount Pleasant" (total 150 acres with an annual rent of &pound;0.6.0) surveyed May 24, 1684 "lying near the head of the main branch of Wicomico Creek." He bought that property from George Wilson on July 26, 1764. (See Rent Rolls, Liber 9, Folio 157 and Somerset Co. Land Records, Liber B, 1759-1765, Folio 245).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">On August 17, 1770, he and his wife, Mary, sold 50 acres of land in "Mount Pleasant" to Thomas Price. The transaction mentions that the land, when he bought it was "then situated in Somerset, now part in Worcester part in Somerset (Counties)". (Worcester Co. Land Records, Liber H, Folio 381-382).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">In the 1783 Tax Assessment, he was assessed for land; "Mount Pleasant" which included 100 acres; 2 horses; and 8 cattle in Somerset Co., MD, Wicomico Hundred. In October 1790, Benjamin Hitch petitioned the court of Somerset Co. that the bounds of Mount Pleasant "are become Precarious and uncertain" (Somerset Co. Judicials 11/1788-3/1791, Folio 184). Furthermore, on October 23, 1790, the court records show: "Benj<sup>m</sup> Hitch commifson &amp; affidavits... to Gillif Polk, James Bennett, Robert Dashiell and John Harris Hayman of Somerset County Gentlemen..." commissioners agree to examine evidence on behalf of "a certain Benjamin Hitch of the County in relation to the bounds of a tract of land called Mount Pleasant." Deponents were Revel Hayman "of lawful age" and William Hayman, age 22. Judgement was granted to Benjamin Hitch and the boundaries lines of Mount Pleasant were reestablished for him following the ruling. (Somerset Co Judicials 11/1788-3/1791, Folio 302, 303).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">The Federal Assessment of 1798 goes further into the property of Benjamin Hitch by indicating that he was owner &amp; occupant of property "situated on the road that divides Somerset from Worcester adjoining Jacob Morris Sr." consisting of "115 acres of land valued at $230 on which is "an old dwelling house, 16' x 15'; kitchen, 12' x 10'; corn house, 12' x 6'; "all 'bad'" valued at $20. He was assessed $15 for all the buildings and $250 for the land that year.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">On May 30, 1800, he wrote a deed for land to Joseph Hitch of Somerset, Co. from Benjamin Hitch of Worcester Co. for 50 acres (for a consideration of &pound;5) for his beloved tract called "Mount Pleasant". (Somerset Co. Land Records, Liber V, Folio 652).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">On September 30, 1809</span><span style="font-family: times new roman">, this same 50 acres of land changed hands between "Joseph Hitch of Penttletion (sic) County in the State of Kaintucky (sic)" and John Hitch of Somerset County. Joseph sold that land to his brother John for &pound;5. We know this is the same land because the record refers to the earlier deed from Benjamin Hitch to Joseph Hitch of May 13, 1803. (See Somerset Co. Land Records, Liber AA, Folio 338)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">Benjamin Hitch kept the remaining 50 acres of Mount Pleasant until he bequeathed it to his son Samuel Hitch in his will of 1814. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">As the various records indicate, "Mount Pleasant" was located near or on the border of Somerset and Worcester Counties in Maryland somewhere near the source of a "main branch" of the Wicomico Creek. This branch has been identified as the modern-day Dividing Creek with "Mount Pleasant" lying about a mile or so south of the present tri-county boundary for Somerset, Worcester and Wicomico Counties on the east side (the Worcester Co. Side) of Meadow Bridge Road (which divides the counties of Somerset and Worcester at such point). </span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">The property evidently stayed in the Hitch family until the early 1900s (after Benjamin's son Samuel owned it, it was left to his son Handy Irving Hitch who died in 1901). The property is located only about two miles from where the author grew up and I have had the opportunity to visit the site many times. Today, it is owned by a Ball family and is a large corn field with a pronounced "hill" in its center. This is no doubt what inspired the original patent holder to name it "Mount Pleasant".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 14pt"><strong>Benjamin Hitch's Family</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">From available records, it appears that Benjamin Hitch married three (3) times in his life. The first marriage was to Mary Pitts, probably in the early 1760s. From this union, there were at least four (4) children: Polly (Mary) (?-?), John (c.1765/75-11/1828), Joseph (7/2/1765-9/28/1847), and Thomas P. Hitch (8/7/1772-2/22/1862). All of these children moved west to Kentucky and Ohio in the late 1790s/early 1800s except for John who stayed in Maryland. Joseph Hitch of Pendleton County, KY and Thomas Hitch of Clermont Co., OH will be covered in more detail in later editions of the HFN.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">Mary (Pitts) Hitch died sometime between 1772 and 1780 and Benjamin took on a new wife whose name has been lost to the years. With his second wife, Benjamin Hitch had at least four (4) additional children: Rachel (?-?), Adam (c.1780/84-after 1840), Robert (before 1784- 12/20/1803), and Samuel (1784-c.1858). All of these children stayed in and around Maryland most of their lives. It is said that this second wife of Benjamin was very mean to the children of the first wife and that is what caused them to move west. Benjamin married a third and final time as an older man to Leah Taylor on May 28, 1803.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 14pt"><strong>Other Records</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">Benjamin Hitch had an account in John Nelms' store in Salisbury, MD from at least 1767, where he bought shoe buckles, pair garters, and tacks for &pound;0/9/0. George Disharoon delivered 4 bu. of corn for a &pound;0/8/0 credit in 1768 and &pound;0/1/0 was carried to Ledger E. In 1775, he bought a gallon of molasses and paid in cash in 1776. He also paid &pound;0/7/6 to the account of Thomas Price, a sailor, in 1768.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">In MD Prerogative court records of 1773, Benjamin Hitch appears in Rachel Hitch's will as; "Rach<sup>l</sup> Hitch her will of Administration Bond by Ben<sup>j</sup> Hitch his administration will annexed with Charles Hayman of Duncan Maine his sureties in the sum of &pound;100 sterl<sup>g</sup> dated 17th August 1773." (Liber 45, Folio 182). On September 7, 1774, Benjamin HITCH did do an account and administered the will of Rachel HITCH for &pound;43.18.0. This records mentions, "of money paid by this accountant to Elgit HITCH which was due him from the Deceased out of his Fathers Estate. . ., &pound;9.3.2" The record also mentions the same for Leah HITCH of an amount of &pound;1.4.3 (Somerset Co. Accounts, Liber 71, Folio 201).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">In 1780, Benjamin was listed with the Maryland Militia in the Revolutionary War in the muster rolls for Salisbury Battalion, Mi(ll) Creek Company.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">In his will written March 21, 1814 and probated April 19, 1814, Benjamin Hitch states: "Leaves Addam Hitch of Somerset County &amp; Samuel Hitch of Worc. Co. each one bed &amp; furniture; Equally divide between Robard (Robert), Addam, Rachel, and Samuel Hitch; Leaves to my youngest son Samuel Hitch, plantation I now dwell 50a. pt. in Worc. Co. and pt. in Somerset Co.; wit; John Morris Jr., Jacob Morris, John Pollitt" (Worcester Co. Wills, Folio 47, 48).</span></p></span><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: times new roman">(</span></p><p> </p><span style="font-family: times new roman"></span><span style="font-family: times new roman"><span style="font-size: 72pt"><p style="text-align: center"> </p><span style="font-family: times new roman"><hr><p>Volume 2, Number 2 Summer 1995</p></span></span></span></font></body></html>
