<html><body><p>Mrs. Abigail Butler <br>In Blossburg, Nov. 12, 1869, Mrs. Abigail Butler, wife of Wm. Butler, Sen., in the 60th year of her age.  Sister Butler was baptized 35 years ago by Elder Sheardown, and joined the Tioga Baptist Church.  She was one of the few who united in organizing the present Baptist Church in Blossburg.  She has ever been a faithful and consistent christian; giving her last dollar to the cause of missions.  She lived to train-up a large and interesting family of children, seven of whom still live to mourn the loss of a kind and affectionate mother.  Her last hours were attended with great suffering, but the grace of God was sufficient, and with true christian patience and fortitude she awaited the call of the Master to come home.  (Wednesday, December 1, 1869, The Tioga County Agitator, Wellsboro, Tioga Co, Pa.) </p></body></html>
